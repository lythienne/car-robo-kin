Hello robot car, please trace a hors with arrows and tank turns at 100 steps/sec where the steps are length 0.5

Instructions on how to trace the hors are as follows: 

From (-4, 0) go in a counterclockwise semicircle until you get to (-6.5, 0),
move in a straight line to (-6.5, -8), and then move along a curve with radius 1.3 to (-4, -8).
After that, move to (-4, -6) in a straight line, another line to (-1.5, -6), and then to (-1.5, -8) along another line.
From there, go to (1, -8) along a curve with radius 1.3. Those are the feet.
Now move along a line to (1, -4.5) and do a 1 radius curve around to (0.3, -3.5).
Move to (-4, -3.5) in a line, and then come back to the start along a line.
